Build a Secure EcmaScript (SES) environment atop an ES6-compliant platform,
enabling safe interaction of mutually-suspicious code, using
object-capabilities.

Derived from the Caja project, https://github.com/google/caja/wiki/SES .

Still under development: do not use for production systems yet, there are
known security holes that need to be closed.

Incorporates (as a git submodule) the Realms shim from
https://github.com/tc39/proposal-realms .
