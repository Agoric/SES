  // every time. To fix this, deepFreeze() needs to be turned into a
  // "Freezer" object that retains a WeakMap of everything it has ever
  // frozen, this def() function should take a Freezer, and the def() exposed
  // as a global should close over the Freezer and deliver it here.
  // deepFreezePrimordials() should use that same Freezer
