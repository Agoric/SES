/**
 * This block replaces the original Function constructor, and the original
 * %GeneratorFunction% %AsyncFunction% and %AsyncGeneratorFunction%, with
 * safe replacements that throw if invoked.
 *
 * These are all reachable via syntax, so it isn't sufficient to just
 * replace global properties with safe versions. Our main goal is to prevent
 * access to the Function constructor through these starting points.

 * After this block is done, the originals must no longer be reachable, unless
 * a copy has been made, and funtions can only be created by syntax (using eval)
 * or by invoking a previously saved reference to the originals.
