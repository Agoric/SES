# Getting Started

SES is a [JavaScript package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ses) that
allows you to run third-party code safely. It runs in Node.js and in the
browser.

## Installing SES

In Node.js:

```javascript
npm install ses
```

In the browser:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ses"></script>
```

## Try it out

In a Node.js repl, after running `npm install ses`:

```javascript
const SES = require('ses');
const s = SES.makeSESRootRealm({consoleMode: 'allow', errorStackMode: 'allow'});
// NOTE: errorStackMode enables confinement breach, do not leave on in production
s.evaluate('1+2'); // returns 3
s.evaluate('1+a', {a: 3}); // returns 4
function double(a) {
  return a#2;
}
const doubler = s.evaluate(`(${double})`);
doubler(3); // returns 6
```

In the browser after loading SES:

```javascript
const s = SES.makeSESRootRealm(...);
s.evaluate(...);
```

## Bundlers

SES works with the main bundlers such as Webpack, Browserify, Rollup,
and Parcel. Simply install SES using npm and `require` or `import` it.

## Building from scratch

Clone the [SES repo](https://github.com/Agoric/SES) and run
`npm run-script build`, which will create a variety of files under
`dist/`. `ses.cjs.js` is the CommonJS version of SES, `ses.esm.js` is
the ES6 module version, and `ses.umd.js` is the UMD version intended for
the browser.

## Webworkers

Note that the Realm shim currently requires either the Node.js `vm`
module, or a browser's `<iframe>` element (it does
`document.createElement('iframe')`), so it won't work in a DOM-less
`WebWorker`, `SharedWorker`, or `ServiceWorker`. If/when the Realms
proposal becomes a standard part of Javascript, these environments ought
to have a native `Realm` object available, and SES should work in all of
them.
